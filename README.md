# JavaScript-Course
Welcome to my collection of web development projects created during my JavaScript course. These projects reflect my learning journey through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Projects Included:
- **Portfolio Website**: A personal site showcasing my background, skills, and work.
- **Tic Tac Toe Game**: A simple two-player game built with JavaScript logic.
- **Calculator**: A basic calculator with interactive UI and functionality.
- **Pizza Menu Interface**: A styled layout for ordering pizzas with form handling.

## Skills Gained:
- Semantic HTML structure
- CSS for styling and layout
- JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic features
- Debugging and testing small applications
- DOM manipulation and basic API understanding

## Purpose:
This course gave me a practical introduction to modern web development. Through hands-on projects, I learned to code, build, and debug functional websites and applications.

## What's Next:
I plan to explore JavaScript frameworks like React and deepen my understanding of backend development to become a full-stack developer.

Thank you for checking out my work!
